# Karabiner

## First load

For some reason `goku` can't manage to create `.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` by itself, so you have to launch Karabiner Elements and create a profile called `default` manually first.

## Update

`.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` is generated by `goku`. Compile and install changes with:

```
goku
```
